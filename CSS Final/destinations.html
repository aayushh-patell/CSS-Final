                        Greece is one of those rare places where ancient history is still very much a part of 
                        modern life. Visitors are as much drawn to the country’s epic intellectual history as its 
                        beauty and charm. Make time for the iconic features of the Acropolis of Athens, which 
                        include the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Mythology buffs 
                        will appreciate Crete, Olympia, Samos, and Naxos for their mythological significance. For 
                        a peaceful beach vacation, the island of Santorini is perfect.

                        From the silvery crests of the Alps to the sparkling Mediterranean Sea, Italy’s beauty is 
                        unparalleled. A visit could mean marveling at the Colosseum after a tender plate of pasta, 
                        or drifting lazily down a canal, your belly full of local Sangiovese. Explore Tuscan 
                        vineyards and olive groves or drool over boutiques in fashionable Milan. Look for mermaids 
                        from the cliffs of Sorrento or nibble on Parma’s famous cheese and prosciutto. Anywhere 
                        you choose, the country will captivate you.

                        There's much more to France than Paris—from the fairy-tale châteaux of the Loire Valley 
                        to the lavender fields of Provence, and the French Riviera's celebrity-studded beaches. 
                        World-famous gastronomy and fine wines provide the perfect complement to the country's 
                        alpine views and architectural masterpieces.The country lures with its magnificent art, 
                        architecture, culture, and cuisine, but there’s also a quieter magic waiting to be explored:
                        the quaint cobbled lanes, and the sweet patisseries around the corner. Go make France your 
                        own.

                        stylish capital cities, Buenos Aires. Stretching from the Tropic of Capricorn towards the 
                        tip of Antarctica, Argentina encompasses a staggering diversity of terrains. You’ll find 
                        everything from lush wetlands to the end-of-the-world archipelago of Tierra del Fuego. Its 
                        most emblematic landscapes are the flatlands of the Pampas and the dramatic steppe of 
                        Patagonia. Read our guide to Argentina for everything you need to know before you go.
