                        Since our first flight in 1996, we've sought to enrich the lives of everyone in our world 
                        by providing safe, friendly and affordable air travel. Right from the start, we put our 
                        guests and our people first; in doing so, we've become one of Canada's most admired and 
                        respected corporate cultures. We’ve also had a lot of fun along the way. Today, flying to 
                        more than 100 destinations, we stay true to our principles and continue to strive for the 
                        highest standards of service and success.

                        Burning aviation fuel to operate our aircraft and using non-renewable energy sources to 
                        heat and power our buildings and operational equipment releases greenhouse gases into the 
                        atmosphere. The most direct and tangible control that we can implement to mitigate our 
                        carbon footprint is to operate our fleet and ground infrastructure as efficiently and 
                        safely as possible. Here at WestJet, we strive for a better world for future generations
                        and we will take every step necessary to ensure our dream becomes a reality.

                        At a cost of approximately $100 million, the WestJet head office building in Calgary, 
                        Alberta that opened in 2009 was constructed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
                        Design (LEED) standards and subsequently awarded a gold LEED certification in 2011. The 
                        innovations in our six-storey home base offer numerous efficient features including 
                        maximized natural light, rainwater reclamation tanks, geothermal heating, efficient 
                        fixtures and many more efficiencies located throughout the building.

                        We currently have one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in North America. 
                        According to Boeing data, fuel efficiency and emissions from our Next-Generation 737 
                        aircraft (600, 700 and 800 series) are approximately 15 to 30 per cent lower on a per 
                        seat basis than the fleet of 737-200 series aircraft we replaced between 2000 and 2003.
                        As our technology advances, we will ensure that our aircraft fleet will be equipped with
                        the most advanced and modern sustainable technology.
